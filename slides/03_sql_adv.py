# alias is used.  This is available using the  .alias() method, which
# returns a unique Alias object representing that table with a particular
# SQL alias.
address_alias_1 = address_table.alias()

# A subquery is used much like a table alias, except we start with a select
# statement.   We call the .subquery() method of select()

select_subq = (

# a table.

# With subqueries and joins we can compose more elaborate statements.  This

# we use join() to link the subquery() with another select()

    .join(address_subq)

### slide::
### title:: Common Table Expressions
# joining to a subquery can also be achieved using a common table
# expression, or CTE. By calling
# cte() instead of subquery(), we get a CTE:

address_cte = address_select.cte()

### slide:: i
# we select/join to the CTE in exactly the same way as we did the subquery.

    select(user_table.c.username, address_cte.c.count)

# a *scalar subquery* returns exactly one row and one column.
# we indicate this intent using the scalar_subquery() method
# after construction

    select(func.count(address_table.c.id))
    .where(user_table.c.id == address_table.c.user_id)
    .scalar_subquery()
)

### slide:: i
# the subquery here refers to two tables.  printing it alone,
# we see both tables in the FROM clause.
print(address_corr)

### slide:: p
# However, a scalar subquery will by default **auto-correlate** in a larger
# SQL expression, omitting a FROM that is found in the immediate
# enclosing SELECT.
